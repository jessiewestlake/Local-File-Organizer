# Johnny.Decimal System Guide

## Overview

The Johnny.Decimal system is designed to help you **find things quickly, with more confidence, and less stress**. It's not just about organizing files - it's about organizing everything in your life.

Based on the official methodology from [johnnydecimal.com](https://johnnydecimal.com/)

## Core Philosophy

**"A system to organise your life"**

The Johnny.Decimal system helps you organize:
- Computer files and folders
- Email and messages  
- Notes and documents
- Physical items
- Digital accounts and subscriptions
- Anything that needs organizing

The goal is always the same: **find things quickly, with confidence, and less stress**.

## How It Works

### The Three Levels

Johnny.Decimal has exactly three levels of organization:

1. **Areas (10-19, 20-29, etc.)**
   - Broad areas of your life
   - Maximum 10 areas total
   - Think "life admin", "work", "hobbies"

2. **Categories (11, 12, 13, etc.)**
   - Collections of similar things within each area
   - Maximum 10 categories per area
   - This is where you work - categories are the most important concept

3. **IDs (11.01, 11.02, etc.)**
   - Individual items, projects, or things
   - Maximum 100 items per category
   - Format: category.item (e.g., 15.23)

### Example Structure

```
10-19 Life admin
├── 11 Me
│   ├── 11.01 Passport renewal
│   ├── 11.02 Health insurance
│   └── 11.03 Gym membership
├── 12 House
│   ├── 12.01 Mortgage documents
│   ├── 12.02 Utilities setup
│   └── 12.03 Home insurance
└── 15 Travel
    ├── 15.01 Trip to Japan
    ├── 15.02 Weekend in Paris
    └── 15.03 Summer vacation
```

## The JDex (Index) - The Heart of the System

**The index IS your Johnny.Decimal system.**

The JDex is a central record of every ID in your system, kept in a notes app like:
- Bear (recommended for Apple users)
- Obsidian (cross-platform favorite)
- Simplenote (simple option)
- Apple Notes

### Why You Need a JDex

1. **Prevents duplicate IDs** - Always know what numbers are taken
2. **Records locations** - Track where things are across your digital life
3. **Enables search** - Find anything by searching your notes
4. **System memory** - Document decisions and track everything
5. **Note-taking** - Each ID becomes a place for notes and thoughts

### How to Use the JDex

1. **One note per ID** - Create a note titled "15.23 Travel insurance"
2. **Location tracking** - Record where the item actually is
3. **Search first** - Always check your JDex before creating new IDs
4. **Add context** - Include keywords, dates, and relevant details

Example JDex entry:
```
15.23 Travel insurance

Location: Email folder, Google Drive
Keywords: insurance, travel, policy, claims
Notes: Policy number ABC123, expires Dec 2025
Claim form saved in email "Insurance claims" folder
```

## Core Principles

### 1. Everything Has One Place
Each item gets exactly one Johnny.Decimal number and lives in exactly one place.

### 2. Numbers Never Change
Once you assign 15.23, it's always 15.23. This creates stability and reliability.

### 3. Limit Your Choices
Maximum 10 at each level forces you to think clearly and avoid overwhelm.

### 4. Categories Are Where You Work
When you sit down to do something, you go to a category. This is where your work happens.

### 5. A Little Friction Is Good
Creating new areas and categories should require thought and consideration.

## Benefits

### Structure and Limits
- Never more than 10 choices at any level
- Clear hierarchy prevents getting lost
- Numbers provide consistent ordering

### Easy Communication
- "Check 15.23 for the travel insurance"
- Short, memorable, speakable numbers
- Works in conversation and documentation

### Cross-Platform Organization
- Same system works everywhere
- Files, email, notes, physical items
- Consistent no matter what tools you use

### Memory and Search
- JDex becomes your system's memory
- Search by ID, keyword, or description
- Never lose track of where things are

## Getting Started

### 1. Design Your Areas
Start with 3-5 broad areas of your life:
- 10-19 Life admin
- 20-29 Work  
- 30-39 Hobbies/Projects

### 2. Add Categories As Needed
Don't pre-plan everything. Add categories when you need them:
- 11 Me (personal documents)
- 12 House (home-related stuff)
- 13 Money (financial matters)

### 3. Create Your JDex
Set up a notes app and start creating entries for each ID.

### 4. Assign IDs to Real Things
Start organizing your actual files, emails, and projects.

## Advanced Concepts

### Multiple Systems
If you have completely separate domains (like work vs. personal), you might need multiple systems with identifiers like:
- SYS.AC.ID (e.g., WORK.15.23)

### Standard Zeros
Some users implement standard patterns across categories:
- xx.01 Inbox
- xx.02 Work in progress  
- xx.03 Checklists
- etc.

### The Librarian
Someone who maintains the system and keeps it organized. This could be you or a team member.

## Best Practices

### For Areas
- Keep them broad - "Life admin" not "Insurance"
- Think about major domains of your life
- Don't worry about using all 10 areas

### For Categories  
- This is where you work
- Prefer fewer, broader categories
- "Money" instead of "Budget", "Savings", "Investments"
- Let them emerge naturally

### For IDs
- Create meaningful descriptions
- Use dates in subfolders (2024-12-15 format)
- One subfolder level is okay, more is chaos
- Start in your JDex, then create files

### For the JDex
- Search your notes before creating new IDs
- Record locations across your digital life
- Add keywords to help future searches
- Include context and decisions

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Creating too many areas** - Start small, grow gradually
2. **Over-categorizing** - Broader categories are usually better  
3. **Skipping the JDex** - This is the heart of the system
4. **Pre-planning everything** - Let the system grow organically
5. **Going too deep** - Stick to exactly three levels

## Why It Works

The Johnny.Decimal system works because it:
- **Reduces decision fatigue** through clear limits
- **Provides structure** without being rigid
- **Scales with your life** from simple to complex
- **Works everywhere** across all platforms
- **Gets better with use** as you learn the numbers

The key insight: It's not about the perfect filing system. It's about reducing the stress and time spent looking for things, so you can focus on what matters.
